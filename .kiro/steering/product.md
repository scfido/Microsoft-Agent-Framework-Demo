# Product Overview

MafDemo is a collection of demo projects and samples showcasing the **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** — a .NET SDK for building AI agents with support for multi-agent orchestration, tool use, and various communication protocols.

The repository serves as a learning resource and experimentation ground, with samples ranging from basic single-agent setups to multi-agent travel planning systems using the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol and a web chat UI using the AG-UI protocol.

The primary language of code comments and agent instructions is Chinese (Simplified). English is used for code identifiers, documentation structure, and agent card metadata.
