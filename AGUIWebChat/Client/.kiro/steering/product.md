# Product Overview

AGUI Web Chat is a browser-based chat client that connects to AI agents using the AG-UI protocol (`@ag-ui/client`). It provides a web interface for interacting with agent backends over HTTP.

The app is in early development — currently a single-page scaffold with a basic agent connection to a local server at `http://localhost:5050`.
